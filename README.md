printfüéâ


The printf function sends formatted output to stdout. A custom _printf() for learning purposes was developed by cohort #8 students Nicks and Musa parsanka. _printf() function format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. These arguments are placed using the percentage '%' operator


Authorized functions and macros
write (man 2 write) malloc (man 3 malloc) free (man 3 free) va_start (man 3 va_start) va_end (man 3 va_end) va_copy (man 3 va_copy) va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

Compilation‚öóÔ∏è
The code must be compiled this way:

*$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic .c

As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)

The main files will include your main header file (main.h): #include main.h

Use & Examples
Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...); Use - General: _printf("format string", var1, var2, ...);

Examples:

Basic String: _printf("%s Alx", "Hello");`

Output: Hello Alx
Print integers: _printf("This is an array element: arr[%d]:%c", 32, arr[32]);`

Output: This is an array element arr[32]:A
Many other specifiers and flags were added and by combinig those the _printf() function generate a different ouput. The following list are the specifiers and flags allowed.

Use & Examples
